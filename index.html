    <h1>Carbon Pricing: A Practical Path To Slowing Climate Change</h1>
    <p>
        This project explains why carbon pricing is one of the most effective,
        research-supported strategies for reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
        A fair and well-designed system can cut pollution, encourage innovation,
        and protect households.

<section id="why">
    <h2>Why Focus on Carbon Pricing?</h2>
    <p>
        Fossil fuels appear cheap only because the real costs—heatwaves,
        flooding, health impacts, and long-term climate damage—are not included
        in the price. Carbon pricing corrects this problem. By attaching a cost 
        to each ton of emissions, cleaner energy becomes more competitive, and 
        businesses and households are encouraged to reduce pollution in ways that
        fit their needs and budgets.
    </p>

<section id="what">
    <h2>What Is Carbon Pricing?</h2>
    <p>
        Carbon pricing charges money for each ton of carbon dioxide released 
        into the atmosphere. It turns pollution into a financial cost instead of 
        an invisible side effect.
    </p>

    <h3>Two Main Approaches</h3>

    <p>
        <strong>Carbon Tax:</strong> A fixed price per ton of emissions. It is 
        predictable and encourages long-term planning for cleaner alternatives.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Cap and Trade:</strong> A limit is set on total emissions. Companies 
        must hold permits for each ton they emit. Firms that can reduce pollution 
        cheaply do so and sell extra permits to others. This guarantees a specific 
        emissions level.

            <h3>Widespread Global Adoption</h3>
            <p>
                The World Bank reports that 73 carbon pricing systems now operate 
                worldwide, covering about 23 percent of global emissions and raising 
                around 95 billion dollars in revenue. These systems continue to expand
                across Europe, Asia, and North America.

            <h3>Real-World Emission Reductions</h3>
            <p>
                A 2024 Nature Communications meta-analysis reviewed 80 strong studies 
                of 21 carbon pricing policies. At least 17 policies produced measurable 
                emission reductions between 5 and 21 percent, even with moderate prices.

            <div class="image-space">Image Placeholder</div>
            <h3>Smart Design Improves Fairness</h3>
            <p>
                Research from economists such as Gilbert Metcalf shows that predictable 
                pricing, wide coverage, and clear revenue recycling make carbon pricing 
                more effective and more fair, especially when funds are returned to 
                households.

    <h2>Concerns and Counterarguments</h2>

    <div class="card-grid">

        <div class="card">
            <h3>“This will hurt low-income households”</h3>
            <p>
                Energy costs can rise, but this can be addressed by returning revenue 
                to the public. Equal per-person “carbon dividends” often leave low and 
                middle-income households better off than before.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
            <h3>“Businesses will move to countries without carbon rules”</h3>
            <p>
                Border carbon adjustments level the playing field by charging imported 
                goods for their emissions. This protects domestic industries and encourages 
                global participation.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
            <h3>“Carbon pricing alone cannot solve climate change”</h3>
            <p>
                Carbon pricing is not a full solution by itself. It works best when paired 
                with clean-energy standards, public investments, and research support. 
                Together, these tools drive deeper long-term reductions.
            </p>
        </div>

    </div>
</section>

<section id="how">
    <h2>How This Solution Would Work in Practice</h2>

    <p>
        A strong carbon pricing system would begin with a clear, gradually rising price. 
        This path gives businesses and households time to adjust and plan cleaner 
        investments. The policy would cover emissions upstream, ensuring broad coverage 
        without complicated administration.
    </p>

    <p>
        Revenue could be used to support households through dividends, invest in clean 
        technology and public transit, and help communities that currently depend on 
        fossil fuel jobs.
    </p>

    <p>
        To prevent industries from relocating, a border carbon adjustment would ensure 
        fair competition and encourage trading partners to adopt similar standards.
