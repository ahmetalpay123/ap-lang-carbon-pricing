    <h1>Carbon Pricing: A Practical and Scalable Climate Solution</h1>
    <p>
        This website presents a research-backed argument on why carbon pricing is one of the most effective and realistic
        tools for reducing global greenhouse gas emissions. The project synthesizes findings from multiple credible sources
        and evaluates both benefits and criticisms.
    </p>

<div class="section">
    <h2>Thesis</h2>
    <div class="card">
        Carbon pricing is a practical and effective climate solution because it directly reduces emissions, generates revenue for 
        sustainable programs, and encourages long-term investment in cleaner technologies. When designed well, it remains fair, 
        economically stable, and widely adaptable across different regions.
    </div>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>Evidence from Research</h2>

    <div class="card">
        A 2023 World Bank report shows that carbon pricing revenues have reached nearly 100 billion dollars globally. 
        These funds can support renewable energy development, infrastructure upgrades, and climate adaptation efforts.
    </div>

    <div class="card">
        A 2024 Nature Communications meta-analysis evaluated 80 studies and found that carbon pricing programs achieved 
        measurable emission reductions ranging from five to twenty-one percent across seventeen different systems. 
        This confirms that carbon pricing works across a variety of economies and policy structures.
    </div>

    <div class="card">
        Research also shows that predictable carbon pricing helps businesses plan long-term investments in cleaner 
        technologies because it creates clear financial incentives to reduce emissions.
    </div>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>Counterargument and Rebuttal</h2>

    <div class="card">
        Some critics argue that carbon pricing may place unfair burdens on lower-income communities or lead to uneven 
        responsibility between countries. These concerns are valid, especially given global inequality in emissions contributions.
    </div>

    <div class="card">
        However, studies show that carbon pricing remains fair and effective when revenue is used responsibly. 
        Governments can return funds to households, invest in public transportation, or reduce other taxes. 
        This prevents financial hardship while strengthening support for the policy. Evidence also shows that 
        carbon pricing can be implemented upstream, reducing consumer impact.
    </div>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>Solutions Supported by Carbon Pricing</h2>

    <div class="card">
        Carbon pricing gives governments the financial ability to scale renewable energy, expand energy efficiency programs, 
        and support climate-resilient infrastructure. Nearly 100 billion dollars in annual revenue already supports these solutions.
    </div>

    <div class="card">
        Businesses respond to price signals by reducing emissions, improving efficiency, and investing in cleaner technologies. 
        Predictable pricing schedules make it easier for industries to transition without economic instability.
    </div>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>Call to Action</h2>

    <div class="card">
        Communities, schools, and local governments can advocate for transparent and well-designed carbon pricing programs. 
        Supporting public education, promoting climate literacy, and encouraging political engagement all help strengthen 
        the push for effective climate policy.
    </div>

    <div class="card">
        Strong climate action happens when groups collaborate. Carbon pricing is not a distant idea. 
        It is already working around the world, and scaling it can accelerate global progress.
